# Contributor Guidelines

- Every code change must be accompanied by regression tests.
- Any user-reported bug signals a failure in both implementation and testing. When a bug is discovered, document the testing gap and add guidelines here to prevent similar issues in the future. This file is our living record of lessons learned and improved testing strategies; keep it updated.
